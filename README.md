# BookStore Database Design & Programming with MySQL

## Overview

This project simulates the role of a Database Administrator tasked with designing and implementing a MySQL relational database system for managing operations of a bookstore. The system includes tables for books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more.

By completing this project, you'll gain practical experience with database design, SQL programming, and user management in MySQL.

##  Tools and Technologies

- **MySQL** â€“ for building and managing the database.
- **VS Code** â€“ as the development environment.
- **Draw.io** â€“ for visualizing the ER diagram (optional).
- **SQLTools / MySQL Extension** â€“ for connecting to MySQL from VS Code.

## Project Objectives

- Design and implement a normalized relational database.
- Create MySQL tables using appropriate data types and relationships.
- Enforce data integrity through primary and foreign keys.
- Manage user access with MySQL roles and privileges.
- Execute queries to retrieve and analyze bookstore data.
